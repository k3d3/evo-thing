evolution screensaver thing

how should it start? should each pixel be its own species?

Should an limited amount of species exist? How should they get distributed in the first place? Should they all be in one group, or dispersed?
If all in one group, should they be equal and square amounts, or should they be randomized?
If dispersed, should the amount of each species vary?

^ that stuff should be change-able without too much effort to change anything else, as that is just laying out the initial form.
The rest of the logic should be split out completely.
For now, 8 species should exist, with equal boundaries, just as squares.

What traits should each species have?
- Health
- Attack strength
  - When an attack occurs, this value (plus a small random value) should determine who wins, or if there's a tie.
- Desire to attack?
  - This value (plus a small random value) must be above a threshold for an attack to occur.
  - If few attacks occur over enough rounds, this threshold could be dynamically lowered.
- Frequency of attack
  - When an attack occurs, this value (plus a small random value) should be the number of rounds until the next attack occurs.
- Length of life
  - Regardless of health or attacks, this value should be the number of rounds that a pixel survives.
- Chaos value
  - For each round, a purely randomly generated value that determines if the pixel should die an unexpected death.

- When a pixel dies, it should cede its position to a randomly-chosen enemy on the species' boundary.
Additionally, all traits should have a colour and single-letter name associated with it, to show live stats on the side.

Should all pixels of a species have the exact same traits, or should they slightly vary?
- They should slightly vary, but hard to say by how much. Perhaps it should be a random walk, to create areas of low and high strength.

Should there be separate genomes that can be formed? How do those form?
- For now, no. This shouldn't be too hard to add in later, if desired. This is kinda needed for any evolution to occur, though.

What order should the pixels attack each other?

Each pixel is surrounded by 4 sides (8 if counting corners) - excluding the pixels containing the same species, how is a particular enemy chosen?
I suppose randomness is a good option to begin with.
Additionally, desire to attack and frequency of attack should play a part, so some pixels won't attack at all.

What happens if a pixel has no desire to attack, but has to defend against another attack?

If loss of life occurs within a blob (i.e. only the same species surrounds it), what should happen?
- One of these options:
- 1) The pixel goes grey, and is considered a neutral "enemy" that does not attack.
- 2) Pixels surrounded only by the same species cannot die
- 3) A random pixel from the boundary is substituted, ceding an edge pixel to an enemy

Should the size of a species contribute to the edge pixels' strength in some way?
- It could be based on the number of surrounding pixels that belong to the enemy vs the same species
